   * XApplication is the back-bone of your application. XApplication
   * does the following:
   * - Initializes and maintains the connection with X, and provides
   *   access to important X variables (such as the values for black
   *   and white colors).
   * - Implements the event loop via its Run() method. In the event
   *   loop, new events are received from X, packaged up as our own
   *   custom Event objects, and added to the EventQueue object.
   *   Events are then peeled off the event queue in FIFO order, and
   *   asked to deliver themselves.
   * 
   * XApplication is a *singleton*: There is only one instance of it in
   * existence throughout the lifetime of the application. As such,
   * you don't directly instantiate the XApplication object. Instead,
   * you call XApplication::GetInstance().
