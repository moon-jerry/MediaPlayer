  /**
   * A basic timer class that integrates with an EventQueue object. To
   * use, instantiate a Timer with the delay specified in
   * milliseconds, indicate whether the timer repeats, and specify the
   * object that will be called whenever the timer triggers.
   * 
   * You should not need to modify this class to make it work, though
   * you must ensure that the EventQueue object regularly calls the
   * "ServiceTimer" method in its ProcessNextEvent() method to ensure
   * the Timer can check whether enough time has elapsed to notify its
   * listeners.
   * 
   * You must explicitly call "Start" to start the timer.
   * 
   * Caveats: Precision of the timer will be limited to how often ServiceTimer()
   *          is called by EventQueue via ProcessNextEvent. The timer is not
   *          guaranteed to notify its listeners at the elapsed time
   *          specified.
   *
   * As with other objects, you are responsible for deallocating any memory for this Timer * when you are finished with it.
