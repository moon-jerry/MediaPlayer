  /**
   * Component is one of the biggest classes in the framework as it is
   * the "thing" that users interact with: It represents anything that
   * is visible, and anything that can respond to mouse and key
   * events. It is also the base class for the XWindow class, which
   * represents the actual window.
   * 
   * Components can contain other components (AddComponent). This
   * creates your interactor tree, a hierarchical ordering of
   * interactive components. The root of this interactor tree is an
   * XWindow object.
   * 
   * Components have a location and bounds. This location is in the
   * coordinate system of its parent Component. For example, if
   * component A is a child of the window, and has a location of (5,
   * 5), then that location is relative to the top-left corner of the
   * window's display area. If component A has a child, component B,
   * with a location of (10, 5), then its location in the window is
   * (15, 10), since (10, 5) is relative to the top-left corner of its
   * parent, component A, whose location is (5, 5).
   * 
   * While the location of the component is relative to its parent's
   * coordinate system (i.e., its location), any painting and
   * interaction in the component is assumed to be in the coordinate
   * system of the component itself. For example, say the user clicks
   * at point (17, 20) on the window. In our example above, that point
   * corresponds to point (12, 15) in component A's coordinate system.
   * Thus, when component A receives that mouse event, the coordinates
   * will be relative to the top-left corner of it, rather than in
   * window coordinates.
   * 
   * Because coordinates in events are assumed to be in the coordinate
   * system of the component itself, *you* are responsible for
   * properly translating coordinates to children coordinates if you
   * pass events on to them. For example, in our example above, (17,
   * 20) in the window coordinate system translates to (12, 15) in
   * component A's corrdinate system, and (2, 10) in component B's
   * coordinate system.
   * 
   * Components respond to events via the HandleKeyEvent and
   * HandleMouseEvent methods.
   *
   * When the component needs to be painted, the Paint method is
   * called with a Graphics object. All drawing operations occur
   * through the Graphics object. Typically, what you do is write a
   * single implementation of Paint in Component, setting up all
   * relevant variables in the Graphics context object (such as
   * foreground/background color), then call the internal (protected)
   * method, PaintComponent. Subclasses then override PaintComponent
   * to implement custom painting behavior, with the Graphics object
   * already assumed to be configured for drawing for that Component.
   *
   * Once the Component has painted itself, it should paint its
   * children. Prior to doing this, it needs to set up the Graphic
   * context's AffineTransform to shift the coordinate system to that
   * of each child. This allows each Component to assume that its
   * top-left corner is the origin, and paint accordingly.
   * 
   * Important: Components should only paint themselves (and their
   * children) when their visible attribute is set to true. If a
   * component is not visible, then its children should *not* be
   * painted, regardless of the state of the visible attribute for
   * them.
   * 
   * Whenever the component changes its visual presentation, it should
   * call one of the "Repaint" methods. The Repaint methods should add
   * a PaintEvent event to the Application event queue to be repainted
   * in the future.
